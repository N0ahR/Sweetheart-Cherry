<h5>Skeena is a cultivar of cherry originating in Canada.</h5>

<div class="center-justified">
 <br><h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cultivar history &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
      <dl>
        <dd>The deliciously smelling, spring blooms of the Skeena Cherry are followed by juicy, commercial grade cherries that are ready to harvest during the late summer months. These cherries are large and resistant to cracking, so you get to keep more of the cherries you grow. Plus, they‚Äôre ideal for preserving in jams or baking into your favorite cherry recipes.

Also, the Skeena Cherry Tree is low maintenance and self-fertile. That means you don‚Äôt have to plant this cherry tree with a companion in order to have prolific quantities of fruit. It also means that it's ideal for planting with other cherry trees that aren't self-fertile.</dd><br>
<br><h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tree Characteristic&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
        <dd>Trees of the Skeena cherry are vigorous and spreading, with a medium flower density. It is considered significantly easier to manage its habit compared to the Lapins cultivar. Like its Stella ancestor, it is self-fertile. It blooms about 4-5 days later than Bing.</dd>
<br><h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fruit Characteristics&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
        <dd>Skeena is considered a late-season cherry, ripening 12-15 days after Bing. Its fruits are large and very firm, with dark red flesh and dark red to black skin. It has a higher cracking resistance than the standard cultivars. However, very high temperatures for several days can cause the fruit to become too soft, leading to post-harvest problems.</dd>
